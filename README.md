# FTR Eval MCP (`@asp-sail/ftr-eval-mcp`)

An MCP server and interactive CLI that automates the AWS Foundational Technical Review (FTR) partner self-assessment process. It evaluates partner-submitted compliance documents (SOC 2 Type II reports and WAFR reports) against defined controls and returns structured PASS/FAIL decisions with reasoning.

---

## Overview

Partners seeking AWS validation must submit evidence for two distinct review tracks:

| Track | Document Required | Controls Evaluated |
|---|---|---|
| **SOC 2** | SOC 2 Type II Report | SOC-001 through SOC-005 |
| **WAFR** | AWS Well-Architected Framework Review Report | WAFR-FTR-001 through WAFR-FTR-004 |

This package provides two ways to evaluate submissions:

1. **MCP Server** — Exposes evaluation tools to AI assistants (Kiro, Claude, etc.) via the Model Context Protocol
2. **Interactive CLI** — A terminal-based evaluation workflow with guided prompts, progress spinners, and color-coded results

---

## Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18.0.0
- AWS credentials configured (for Bedrock access)

---

## Usage

### MCP Server Mode (default)

Start the MCP server for use with AI assistants:

```bash
ftr-eval-mcp
```

With options:

```bash
ftr-eval-mcp serve --transport stdio --region us-east-1 --model <bedrock-model-id>
```

### Interactive CLI Mode

Launch the guided evaluation workflow:

```bash
ftr-eval-mcp evaluate
```

This will prompt you to:
1. Select a report type (SOC 2 or WAFR)
2. Enter the path to your PDF report
3. Choose a specific control or evaluate all

### Non-Interactive Mode

For scripting and CI/CD pipelines:

```bash
ftr-eval-mcp evaluate --report-type wafr --file ./path/to/report.pdf
```

Evaluate a single control:

```bash
ftr-eval-mcp evaluate --report-type soc2 --file ./report.pdf --control-id SOC-001
```

### CLI Options

```
ftr-eval-mcp evaluate --help

Options:
  --report-type <type>   Report type: soc2 or wafr
  --file <path>          Path to the PDF report file
  --control-id <id>      Specific control ID to evaluate (optional)
  --region <region>      AWS region (default: us-east-1)
  --model <modelId>      Bedrock model ID
```

## MCP Tools

When running as an MCP server, the following tools are exposed:

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `parse_pdf` | Parse a PDF file and extract text content |
| `get_controls` | Get control definitions for a report type |
| `get_calibration_guide` | Get the calibration guide for a report type |
| `evaluate_submission` | Evaluate a PDF submission against controls |
| `get_prompt_template` | Get the FTR evaluation prompt template |

---

## Development

### Build

```bash
npm run build
```

### Run Tests

```bash
npm test
```

### Run Locally (without installing globally)

```bash
npm run build
node dist/server.js evaluate
```

### Build Standalone Binaries

```bash
npm run build:binaries
```

This produces platform-specific executables in `binaries/` for macOS (ARM/x64), Linux (x64/ARM), and Windows (x64).

## Kiro Power Tool

This project also includes a Kiro power at `.kiro/powers/ftr-self-assessment/` for direct use within the Kiro IDE. The steering files load automatically and give Kiro full calibration criteria to evaluate FTR submissions in chat.

## Controls Reference

### SOC 2 Controls

| Control | Description |
|---|---|
| **SOC-001** | SOC 2 Type II report must be active (issued within the last 12 months) |
| **SOC-002** | Auditor opinion must be exactly "Unqualified" |
| **SOC-003** | AWS must be listed as an in-scope cloud provider |
| **SOC-004** | The partner's specific solution must appear in the audit scope |
| **SOC-005** | Both Security AND Availability Trust Service Categories must be present |

### WAFR Controls

| Control | Description |
|---|---|
| **WAFR-FTR-001** | Review must be led by an authorized reviewer AND completed within 12 months |
| **WAFR-FTR-002** | Zero active High-Risk Issues (HRIs) in the Security pillar |
| **WAFR-FTR-003** | Zero active High-Risk Issues (HRIs) in the Operational Excellence pillar |
| **WAFR-FTR-004** | Zero active High-Risk Issues (HRIs) in the Reliability pillar |

---

## Key Rules

- Expired reports (SOC 2 or WAFR older than 12 months) always **FAIL**
- SOC 2 Type I does **not** qualify; must be Type II
- Submitting a WAFR report for a SOC 2 control (or vice versa) **FAILS** immediately
- Only **active** (open/unresolved) HRIs cause failure — resolved HRIs are ignored
- Medium-Risk Issues (MRIs) never cause failure regardless of count or status

---

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | Evaluation completed (regardless of PASS/FAIL), or user cancelled |
| 1 | Error: AWS credentials not configured, invalid inputs, or system error |
